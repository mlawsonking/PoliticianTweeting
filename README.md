# PoliticianTweeting
Collection of Jupyter notebooks used to scrape tweets for Senators, House reps and Governors from 2021-2022

Some of the bizarre try loops and exception handling is due to the nature of twitch and 
it's somewhat random nature in scraping tweets. Increased date ranges tend to decrease the liklihood of 100% scraping
so it was limited to one-month increments, and repeated 10 times per person per month to get them all.

The twitter handles were updated 5/12/2022, before the majority of the data was collected.
